# Create-LotteryNumbers
Creates 10 UK Lottery 'Lotto' lines of 6 numbers where the numbers are never re-used and all 59 numbers are used

There are 59 numbers in the UK 'Lotto' game, each line consisting of 6 numbers.

The goal of the script was to use all 59 numbers only once.

To that end the script creates 9 lines all with unique numbers.

The 10th line uses the remaining 5 unused number and adds 1 random number that has previously been used to get the 6 numbers required for the final 10th line.

Example:

Lottery Numbers - 14,17,25,28,39,46

Lottery Numbers - 4,21,38,49,52,55 

Lottery Numbers - 23,35,48,50,51,53

Lottery Numbers - 2,3,12,16,36,58  

Lottery Numbers - 9,11,15,22,29,32 

Lottery Numbers - 13,20,26,33,41,45

Lottery Numbers - 8,10,19,34,40,43 

Lottery Numbers - 1,6,24,30,37,54

Lottery Numbers - 7,27,42,44,56,57

Lottery Numbers - 4,5,18,31,47,59 (Last 5 unused numbers plus 1 reused number)
